            By the mid-13th century BCE, the Late Shang dynasty had developed writing, which mostly exists as divinatory inscriptions on the ritualistic oracle bones but also as bronze inscriptions.[73][74] As many as 11 oracle script characters may refer to music to some extent, some of which could be iconographical representations of instruments themselves.[75] The stone bells qing appears to have been particularly popular with the Shang ruling class,[n 11] and while no surviving flutes have been dated to the Shang,[77] oracle script evidence suggests they used ocarinas (xun), transverse flute (xiao and dizi), douple pipes, the mouthorgan (sheng), and maybe the pan flute (paixiao).[78][n 12] Due to the advent of the bronze in 2000 BCE,[80] the Shang used the material for bells—the ling [zh] (鈴), nao [zh] (鐃) and zhong (鐘)[59]—that can be differentiated in two ways: those with or without a clapper and those struck on the inside or outside.
