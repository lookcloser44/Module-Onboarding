            The Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), established by Qin Shi Huang, lasted for only 15 years, but the purported burning of books resulted in a substantial loss of previous musical literature.[67] The Qin saw the guzheng become a particularly popular instrument; as a more portable and louder zither, it meet the needs of an emerging popular music scene.[103][n 17] During the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), there were attempts to reconstruct the music of the Shang and Zhou, as it was now "idealized as perfect".[100][67] A Music Bureau, the Yuefu, was founded or at its height by at least 120 BCE under Emperor Wu of Han,[104][n 18] and was responsible for collecting folksongs. The purpose of this was twofold; it allowed the Imperial Court to properly understand the thoughts of the common people,[89] and it was also an opportunity for the Imperial Court to adapt and manipulate the songs to suit propaganda and political purposes.
